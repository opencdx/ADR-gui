# OpenCDx Backend Mock

You can run a mock of the ADR API using [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) with either their [desktop application](https://mockoon.com/download/#download-section) or [CLI](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/cli#installation)

Use `adr.json` as the environment file.
